# Shaka_Server
Server / API for Shaka, which acts as a shared queue that Spotify users can contribute to

# TODO
Currently only uses polling and should be refactored to use sockets instead.

Needs to be documented with javadoc.

Implement shuffling ability.

Change way the queue is implemented to be more similar to Spotify's queue for consistency.
